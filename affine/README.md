# Affine-ready copy

This folder contains copies of all markdown notes with file names sanitized
(lowercase, hyphen-separated, no spaces or uppercase) to avoid Affine file name
issues. Contents of notes are unchanged. Original repo remains untouched.

- Notes live in `notes/` with slugged filenames derived from their original paths.
- Assets were copied to `images/`.
- `mapping.tsv` lists the original path for each note and its Affine copy.

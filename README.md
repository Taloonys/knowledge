# knowledge
* Well, it's just a simple personal notes (tbh I've never rechecked them, but some my friends do... idk for what).
* Here I described my associations with some themes (mostly it's in C++) and shortened some term descriptions.
* Most of the notes a Russian only. Currently gonna write all in English.
* This repo is `designed for obsidian` usage.. because It's more markdown format orientated (than notion at least).

# knowledge
* Well, it's just a simple personal notes (tbh I've never rechecked them, but some my friends do... idk for what).
* Here I described my associations with some themes (mostly it's in C++) and shortened some term descriptions.
* Most of the notes are Russian only.

# Structured like...
- every single dir has:
   - `0-main.md` files -> start "any navigation" from them!
   - bunch of `.md` files with info
   - `image-storage` dir for images only

 # Designed in obisian, but ok for just git reading
* Settings for obsidian (It makes files readable in git raw markdown view)
  - Options -> Files and Links -> Use [[Wikilinks]] -> "False"
  - Options -> Files and Links -> New link format   -> "Relative path to file"
  - Options -> Editor          -> Advanced          -> Convert pasted HTML to Markdown -> "True"

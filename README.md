* Well, it's just a simple personal notes (tbh I've never rechecked them, but some my friends did... idk for what).
* Here I described my associations with some themes (mostly it's in C++) and shortened some term descriptions.

# Structured like...
- every single dir has:
   - `main.md` files -> start "any navigation" from them!
   * `resources` dir which countains: 
	   * bunch of `.md` files with info
	   - `image-storage` dir for images only

 # Designed in obsidian, but ok for just git reading
* Settings for obsidian (It makes files readable in git raw markdown view)
  - Options -> Files and Links -> Use [Wikilinks](Wikilinks) -> "False" (not sure, but looks like sth changed...)
  - Options -> Files and Links -> New link format   -> "Relative path to file"
  - Options -> Editor          -> Advanced          -> Convert pasted HTML to Markdown -> "True"
